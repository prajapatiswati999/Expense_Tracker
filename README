# ExpenseTracker 
 
ExpenseTracker is a simple web application designed to help users manage their finances. It allows users to add income and expenses, dynamically track their balance, and view a history of transactions. The app is built using Flask (Python) for the backend, with HTML and CSS for the frontend. 
 
## Overview 
 
The ExpenseTracker application is structured as a web application using the Flask framework for handling HTTP requests and responses. The user interface is created with HTML for structure and CSS for styling. Currently, the application stores transaction data in memory, as no persistent database is specified. 
 
### Technologies Used 
- **Python:** The core programming language used to run the Flask application. 
- **Flask:** A lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python, used to handle the backend logic. 
- **HTML & CSS:** Used for creating the structure and styling of the web application's user interface. 
 
### Project Structure 
- `app.py`: This is the main Flask application file. It defines a simple Flask app with a root route that returns a welcome message. 
 
## Features 
 
- **Add Income and Expenses:** Users can input their income and expenses through the app interface. 
- **Dynamic Balance Tracking:** The app calculates and updates the user's balance dynamically based on the transactions entered. 
- **Transaction History:** Users can view a history of all transactions entered into the system.
